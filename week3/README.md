# Week 3

Some materials (demo in class and slides) are missing in the original repo, so I try [collected them on github via keyword](https://github.com/search?q=filenote_r&type=code), and I found the original source url from this [repo](https://github.com/nella17/NYCU-Secure-Programming-2021/tree/fc90eb2a97f0aaa4bc6d3427ac722f5ea4a79363/Pwn/Lab-3). And I checked the info of file on Google drive, and I believe that they're the official release files.
